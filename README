|                                                                 |
| bSyncFolder is a small console app to sync your data.           |
|                                                                 |
| It is made mostly for users who want to synchronize             |
| their music stored on PC to another devices like:               |
|     - USB flash-drives                                          |
|     - Mobile phones                                             |
|                                                                 |
| How it is working?                                              |
|     - it scans your specified main (stored on your PC) folder   |
| and target (i.e. USB flash drive) for differences. If the main  |
| folder has files that doesn't exist in target folder it copies  |
| them to target directory. If target dir has files that are not  |
| exist in main they will be deleted from target dir.             |
|                                                                 |
| The principle is simple:                                        |
|     - you can manage all the music from PC. Delete old or not   |
| used files and add new ones. With bSyncFolder app they will     |
| appear in target directory.                                     |
|                                                                 |
